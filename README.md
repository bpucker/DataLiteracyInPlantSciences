This repository contains scripts and data sets associated with the ['Data Literacy in Plant Sciences'](https://github.com/bpucker/teaching/tree/master/GE32_DataLiteracyInPlantSciences) course.


## (1) Introduction
### (1.1) Establishing access to de.NBI cloud

### (1.2) Documentation
Please ensure a proper documentation of all analyses. This includes the version of applied tools, the parameters, input files, and output files.

### (1.3) Introduction to Linux
File names should not include spaces or other special characters.
Important commands are:

`cd <FOLDER>` changes the working directory to the specified folder

`mkdir <FOLDER>` creates a new folder in the working directory

### (1.4) Downloading and transferring files
`scp` this function can be used to transfer files. Please see the [documentation](https://linux.die.net/man/1/scp) for details.

`wget` this function can be used to download files. Please see the [documentation](https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/wget-1.8.1/html_mono/wget.html) for details.

`md5sum <FILENAME>` calculates a hash (finger print) for a given file. This hash can be used to check the complete transfer of files.
